    "With the reintroduction of the chicken sandwich from Popeye's, the Chicken Wars have official re-emerged with Chick-Fil-A and Popeye's as the main contenders, with other restaurants such as Zaxby's, Wendy's and KFC attempting to gain market share during this event. However, as the world grows more and more connected every day, it is not a question of if, but when will the Chicken Wars become global. With Chick-Fil-A having a solid hold in the US, and Popeye's already having restaurants around the world, the question that will be answered as a part of my Applied Data Science Capstone Specialization (through IBM and Coursera) is: Where Could American Chicken Sandwich Restaurants Thrive in Paris? With Paris being a center of cuisine for the world, it will soon host some of the best Chicken Restaurants as well. In this report, you will find my findings from my analysis based on the knowledge of Applied Data Science I learned from this course. "

    "First, I scraped the populations of each arrondissement and placed it in a data frame. For each 20 arondissements, I scraped the data for it's number, nickname, and the population for the years 1975, 1982, 1990, 1999, 2007, and 2016. Then, I added to columns that would analyze from the data frame if the population has increased since 1975 and if it has increased since 1999, and then isolated the arrondissements that increased in both. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we want to look at arrondissements with both a long and short term increase in population is because while Paris has a lot of tourist, being a fast food restaurant means that in order to be successful, the area must have the local support, and if the arrondissement is decreasing in population, it will be harder to secure that local support.\n",

For our last part, we will look at the density of these restaurants, and figure out where is best to set up shop. I created a new data frame that, by arrondissement, shows its size (in square kilometers), it's population, number of residents, density of people per square kilometer, and density of restaurants per square kilometer."

    "Lastly, in order to help make the best decision of where the new restaurant could be, I created a 'choice factor' which is the population density divided by the restaurant density. This gives us Arrondissements 12 and 15 with the highest choice factor, and Arrondissements 13 and 19 with the lowest. "

    "Here we have can group the final four arrondissements into two distinct areas, high choice factors or low choice factors. Depending on the sales model for the company, it may do the company better to be in a high choice factor area, with a higher ratio of population density to restaurant density, where being among the competition in a growing area will do well for your business model (I believe this is the route best for a restaurant like Popeye's). A restaurant that would prefer a lower ratio of population density to restaurant density, where being able to be isolated from the competition in a growing area, would look to pick a low choice factor (I believe this is the route best for a restaurant like Chick-Fil-A).
